Import feature from mal --,
lets scrape the completed manga section
ok i got that working and for "anime" specifically
but now it needs to
scrape data -> ok i have it in backend -> frontend receives and someone matches each one with a search

idea -backend-
it searchs the database pulls top answer for said anime and then it would just confirm that as a match:
--would this not have a 100% conversion rate for mal? because its already being scrape from it right?--
