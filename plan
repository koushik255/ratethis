Import feature from mal --,
lets scrape the completed manga section
ok i got that working and for "anime" specifically
but now it needs to
scrape data -> ok i have it in backend -> frontend receives and someone matches each one with a search

idea -backend-
it searchs the database pulls top answer for said anime and then it would just confirm that as a match:
--would this not have a 100% conversion rate for mal? because its already being scrape from it right?--
add manga(somehow dude and read thorugh code since this could acuallty be somewhat comp so make sure its not selling me thinks)


public profile pages 


Also make sure the performance is fine on the scraper before i make that public because i dont want to fuck mal with crazy amount of requests
fuck you
